# Samples
The best way to get started with mapsui is to go through the samples.

## The code samples
There are sample apps for each platform. They share a number of Map samples that can be found in this folder in our git repository Samples\Mapsui\Mapsui.Samples.Common\Maps. 
- For 2.0 look [here](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Common/Maps)
- For 1.4 look [here](https://github.com/Mapsui/Mapsui/tree/1.4/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Common/Maps)

## Run the samples
See the samples in action by running the  WPF sample app ([Mapsui.Samples.Wpf](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Wpf)) in the samples folder. On the left side it has a list with all samples.
