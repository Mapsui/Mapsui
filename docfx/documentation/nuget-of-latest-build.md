# NuGet of Latest Build

Mapsui's 'Build' GitHub action creates nugets and stores them as artifacts. Go to [actions](https://github.com/Mapsui/Mapsui/actions), select the build you are interested in and download them at the bottom of the page.

## Build your own nuget package
It is also possible to build you own nuget package locally by running ```scripts\buildpack.bat 3.0.0-custom.1``` from the sln folder. You can set the file location as a Package Source in visual studio.
