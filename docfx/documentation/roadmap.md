- [ ] Everything to .NET 6
- [ ] Cleanup:
  - [ ] Use `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` everywhere (Add to Directory.Build.props) and go through the current suppressions to see if there is a better way.
  - [ ] Fix the remaining warnings wrt IDispose.
  - [ ] Run dotnet format (whitespace, style and analyzers) on the entire solution.
  - [x] Always propagate async back to the caller.
  - [x] Remove nuget packages that we previously needed for things now supported in .NET 6.
  - [ ] Remove code copies of things now in .NET 6 (in the past we copied some .NET Core things which were not in .NET standard).
  - [ ] Remove the #if defines we do not need anymore.
  - [ ] Remove all scripts and configurations we do not use anymore.
  - [ ] Simplify the build scripts now that we do not need the workarounds.
  - [x] Rename master to main.
- [ ] Remove older frameworks:
  - [ ] Remove Xamarin.Forms (but not Mapsui.MAUI, Mapsui.iOS and Mapsui.Android).
  - [x] Remove Uno UWP (but not Mapsui.Uno.WinUI)
  - [x] Remove Avalonia.V0 (but not Avalonia)
- [ ] Merge MapView functionality into MapControl. We need to work this out in more detail.
