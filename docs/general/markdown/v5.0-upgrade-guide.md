# v5.0 upgrade guide 

## List of changes in the order that they were applied.
- Removed `RectFeature`. Instead of `new RectFeature(myRect)` use `new GeometryFeature(myRect.ToPolygon())`
- Removed all events from the MAUI MapControl except for MapInfo. Use gesture recognizers instead.
- Introduced PinchState to replace separate *center*, *radius* and *angle* fields and used in o.a. the Map.Navigator.Pinch method.
- Moved UnSnapRotationDegrees and UnSnapRotationDegrees properties from MapControl to MapControl.Map.Navigator.
- Rename Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color ToNative(this Styles.Color color) to ToMaui.
- Because BaseFeature is now derived from IFeature and the previously not-implemented methods and fields had to be defined as abstract, these now need the `override` keyword in the derived classes.
