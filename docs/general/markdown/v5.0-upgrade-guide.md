# v5.0 upgrade guide 

## List of changes in the order that they were applied.
- Removed `RectFeature`. Instead of `new RectFeature(myRect)` use `new GeometryFeature(myRect.ToPolygon())`
- Removed all events from the MAUI MapControl except for MapInfo. Use gesture recognizers instead.
- Introduced PinchState to replace separate *center*, *radius* and *angle* fields and used in o.a. the Map.Navigator.Pinch method.
- Moved UnSnapRotationDegrees and UnSnapRotationDegrees properties from MapControl to MapControl.Map.Navigator.
