# v4.0 Upgrade Guide 

### Nuget organization changes
The Mapsui core package has been split up into:

- Mapsui.
- Mapsui.Tiling, which has a dependency on BruTile. It contains everything related to the raster tiles, like the TileLayer.
- Mapsui.Nts, which has a dependency on NetTopologySuite (NTS). It replaces everything that was in Mapsui.Geometries.
- Mapsui.Rendering.Skia.
