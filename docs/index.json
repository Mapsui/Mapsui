If you notice important things missing then please post an issue. Moved from PCL to .NET Standard 2.0 Look up compatible frameworks in this table . Viewport moved from Map to MapControl and is readonly Use MapControl.Navigator instead. Moved MapControl.NavigateTo methods to MapControl.Navigator All user map manipulation should go the the Navigator. Introduced Map.Home to initialze the map viewport There is now a Home delegate on the Map object that should be used to set the initial state of the map. MapControl.Map.Home = n => n.NavigateTo(myCenter, myResolution); Reason: This is because in some cases the Navigate methods depend on the envelope and resolutions of the layers and in some cases it takes time for these layers to load their data. Added Map.PanLock, Map.ZoomLock and Map.RotationLock The lock fields can be used on all platforms to lock the user from a certain kind of map manipulation. Added Map.Limiter to limit the extent to which the user can navigate The Limter is an implementation of IViewportLimiter. There are currently three limiters part of Mapsui: ViewportLimiter (default) ViewportLimiterKeepWithin ViewportLimiterWithoutLimits It is also possible to implement your own IViewportLimiter. Added RefreshGraphics, RefreshData and Refresh Use RefreshGraphics if you know the data in the layer has changed and the graphics needs refreshing. Use RefreshData if you know there is new data available in the source. Use Refresh if you need to do both. These methods should only be needed if you manipulate data somehow in your own code. Renamed BoundingBox GetCentroid to Centroid and GetBoundingBox to BoundingBox Turned these methods into proper properties making user code a bit more compact. The Info event was moved from Map to MapControl The MapControl contains most other events as well Removed the InfoLayer list and add an InfoLayer boolean on ILayer To indicate that a layer is a info layer you now need to set it's InfoLayer property. In v1.4 it had to be added to the list of InfoLayers. Removed the HoverLayer method. This is because hover could not be implemented crossplatform and could harm performance. It it is still possible to implement hover yourself using a direct call to MapControl.GetMapInfo. Invert label alignment bottom/top. This was incorrect in v1.4. This will not cause a compile error so don't forget to do a search-replace to fix it. Removed ZoomIn/ZoomOut from WPF MapControl Use the ZoomIn/ZoomOut methode on the navigator."

    "title": "Asynchronous Data Fetching",
    "keywords": "Asynchronous Data Fetching Some background In most mapping clients drawing a map means first gathering data from disk, database or web and after that a map is drawn. Because gathering data takes time the user has to wait for this process to complete. During this process sometimes a white map is shown and the user cannot interact with the map. This experience can be improved by drawing a buffer of the previous image during pan and zoom. But this results in white space along the edged. This can again be countered by other optimizations but there are limits to what can be done along this design path and it tends to lead to hacked up solutions. In Mapsui we completely seperated drawing from fetching data. The renderer only renders the data it has available in memory at that instant. The fetcher runs on a background thread receives messages from the UI thread telling it what to fetch. The async data fetcher architecture The diagram above shows how Mapsui's data fetcher works. The data fetcher runs on a background thread. The UI and Fetcher communicate through non blocking messages. Whenever the user pans or zooms a View Changed message is sent to the Fetcher. Whenever new data arrives a Data Changed message is sent to the UI so that it knows it should redraw the map. The fetcher dumps incoming data into a cache. The UI renderer retrieves whatever is needed from that cache when rendering. Both the fetcher and the renderer can use all kinds of smart tricks. In case of tiling the fetcher can pre‐fetch tiles based on its current view, or on the way the view changes over time. The renderer could search for alternative tiles (higher or lower levels) when the optimal tiles are not available. Those strategies should be tuned to support each other. For instance, in the current implementation the renderer uses higher level tiles when the optimal tiles are not available, and the fetcher pre‐fetches higher level tiles to assist the renderer. But the way they play together is not specified in the interface. This loose coupling keeps things simple and flexible and the renderer never has to wait for the fetcher which results in a smooth (perceived) performance."

    "title": "Skia Scale",
    "keywords": "Skia Scale We have a separate page about this topic because skia scale has caused some confusion in the past and bugs as a consequence. Some context: Device Independent Units Modern devices have a very high resolution. If something is drawn onto the canvas using raw pixels as coordinates the fonts would become tiny and unreadable and lines would become very thin. To correct for this a scale factor is used. Those scaled-up coordinates are called device independent units. Most of the time you deal with the device independent units. Coordinates in SkiaSharp Most (all?) views in SkiaSharp use pixels as coordinates by default but for our purposes we need to use device independent units, so we need to correct for this. There are two ways this can be done: Set the skia view's IgnorePixelScaling. Call the skia view's Scale factor with the appropriate scale. For this you need to request the scale factor from the system. What do we do? We take skia scale into account on a number of places in our code: On WPF and UWP: We set IgnorePixelScaling. On iOS: The GL view we use has no IgnorePixelScaling unfortunately. We determine the skia scale while initializing (or when switching from wpf to skia rendering)ent's size changes. We set the skia scale on the skia surface. This needs to be done in the render loop because this is the only place where we have access to the surface. On Android: We determine the density (pixels per device independent units) while initializing. We initialze the viewport width and height to the skia width and height (on TryInitializeViewport). We set the viewport width and height to the skia width and height whenever the containing parent's size changes. We set the skia scale on the skia surface. This needs to be done in the render loop because this is the only place where we have access to the surface. We pass the skia scale along if we request map info. Why not directly correct the position for scale at the call? Because we want to return the original click position as part of the response. This position can be usefull and we don't want to user to correct for skia scale (in fact we don't want the user to have access to it). When requesting the touch positions when manipulating the map."

We will match Xaml to Skia (not the other way around). We already use the correct technique for Xaml halos for labels styles. Skia does not have the option to displayed symbols in world units. The means the icon will grow bigger if you zoom in. This is unlike regular icon but like regular polgons. This is an exotic feature, you will probably not need this. There are probably some more differences I missed.

    "href": "documentation/projections.html",
    "title": "Projections",
    "keywords": "Projections Projections is a complicated topic. Users of Mapsui have a wide variety of backgrounds. Some are experienced GIS users that just need to know how this specific map component works. Many others are app developers that just happen to need a map for their current app. This makes it hard to explain things clear for everyone. Below are some basic concepts. I like this video introduction to map projections. The most common scenario Much point data is in a coordinates system called WGS84, or lat/long coordinates, or EPSG:4326 . Most maps are in some another coordinate system which is better suited for display. The projection used in most online maps these days is SphericalMercator, or WebMercator, PseudoMercator or EPSG:3857 . The OpenStreetMap tile layer that is used in many samples of Mapsui is also in SphericalMercator. If you use this map your coordinates also need to be in SphericalMercator. By default there is no automatic projection in Mapsui. The Mapsui helper methods for this transformation are SphericalMerator.FromLonLat/ToLonLat. Parts of Mapsui involved in projections Map : There is one Map. It is inevitably in some kind of projection. Layers : There are several layers that provider data. This data should be in the same projection as the Map. If not, different projections will be drawn on top of each other and things go wrong. Providers : Some Layers have a DataSource (Provider). This DataSource could contain data in another projection. This data can be converted to the Map projection but a few things need to be set. Configure Mapsui for automatic projections Currently only the Layer layer type can be set up to do automatic projetions from DataSource to Map. Three things need to be configured for this: The CRS on the Map to know what to project to. The CRS on the DataSource to know what to project from. The Transformation on the Map to calculate the projection from DataSource CRS to the Map CRS. Support for projections The out of the box Mapsui support for projections is limited. The MinimalProjection class only projects between SphericalMercator (EPSG:3857) and WGS84 (EPSG:4326). It is however possible to create your own Transformation. You need to implement the ITransformation interface. Within this implementation you need to use some other projection library. A recommended one is ProjNet4GeoAPI . The most common scenario Most likely you will be fine if you use the same projection as Google and OpenStreetMap. This projection is called SphericalMercator. The official code from the OGC for this projection is EPSG:3857. If you use the OpenStreetMap background layer you use EPSG:3857. Often you have GPS locations or points of interests (POIs) in WGS84 or EPGS:4326. These points need to be transformed to EPSG:3857. There are two ways: Follow the configuration for projections mentioned above and in the ProjectionSample.cs. Use SphericalMercator.FromLonLat to do the transformation manually. Remarks A Layer has a CRS field. This field is used by Mapsui to set it to the Map projection. It should not be set by the user. This is could be confusing. Mapsui is not capable of transforming images. So no transformation of tiles as rasters. No attempt will be made to transform and the CRS fields will be ignored."
